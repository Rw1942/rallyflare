# Rally Dashboard Guide

## User Story

**As a Rally admin,**  
I want to see a clean, peaceful dashboard of all email activity  
So that I can quickly understand what Rally is handling and ensure everything is working smoothly.

### Design Philosophy

The Rally dashboard embodies these principles:

- **Calm and Uncluttered** - Like reading a well-organized inbox, not a technical admin panel
- **Instantly Scannable** - Clear visual hierarchy with color-coded sections
- **Soft and Inviting** - Gentle gradients, rounded corners, and soft shadows
- **Trustworthy** - Shows Rally working invisibly in the background

## Features

### Dashboard Sections

1. **Statistics Overview**
   - Total Messages processed
   - Incoming emails received
   - Outgoing replies sent
   - AI-processed message count

2. **Incoming Messages**
   - All emails received by Rally
   - Shows sender name, email, subject, and time
   - AI-generated summary preview
   - Badges for:
     - Attachments
     - AI Processing status
     - Reply status

3. **Outgoing Replies**
   - All automated replies sent by Rally
   - Shows what Rally sent and when
   - Links back to original messages
   - Preview of AI-generated content

### Message Cards

Each message card displays:
- Sender's name and email address
- Time received (human-readable: "5m ago", "2h ago", "3d ago")
- Subject line
- AI-generated summary or reply preview (first 2 lines)
- Visual badges indicating message status

### Navigation

The dashboard includes a navigation bar with:
- **Activity** (current view)
- **Settings** (coming soon) - Configure general Rally behavior
- **AI Prompts** (coming soon) - Customize AI system prompts and models

## Design Details

- **Primary Gradient**: Purple-to-indigo (#667eea to #764ba2)
- **Background**: Soft gray gradient (#f5f7fa to #e8ecf1)
- **Cards**: Clean white with subtle shadows
- **Text**: Professional gray tones (#2d3748, #718096)

### Typography

- System fonts for native feel: -apple-system, SF Pro, Segoe UI, Roboto
- Clear hierarchy: Large headers, readable body text
- Weights: 400 (regular), 500 (medium), 600 (semi-bold), 700 (bold)

### Interactions

- **Hover Effects**: Cards lift slightly with enhanced shadow
- **Click**: Cards are clickable to view full message details
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

### Badges

Status indicators with custom colors:
- **Attachment** - Warm yellow background
- **AI Processed** - Cool cyan background  
- **Replied** - Fresh green background

## Database Schema Updates

To support the new dashboard, the following fields were added to the `messages` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN direction TEXT CHECK(direction IN ('inbound', 'outbound')) DEFAULT 'inbound';
ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN sent_at TEXT;
ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN reply_to_message_id TEXT;
```

### Direction Field

- `'inbound'` - Messages received by Rally
- `'outbound'` - Replies sent by Rally

This allows the dashboard to cleanly separate incoming vs outgoing messages.

## Running the Migration

To apply the database changes:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply rally_d1 --local  # For local testing
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply rally_d1           # For production
```

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture
