```bash
# 1. Check what's changed
git status

# 2. Stage all changes
git add .

# 3. Commit with clear message
git commit -m "Brief description

- Bullet point details of what changed
- Include any breaking changes
- Note if database migrations needed"

# 4. Push to GitHub (keeps repo in sync)
git push origin main

# 5. Apply database migrations (if any new migrations exist)
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply rally-database --remote

# 6. Deploy the Worker
npx wrangler deploy
```

## Key Wrangler Commands

**Local Development:**
```bash
npx wrangler dev                    # Run locally, uses .dev.vars for secrets
npx wrangler tail                   # View live logs from deployed Worker
```

**Database Operations:**
```bash
# Query remote database
npx wrangler d1 execute rally-database --remote --command "SELECT * FROM messages LIMIT 5"

# List migrations
npx wrangler d1 migrations list rally-database --remote

# Apply migrations to production
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply rally-database --remote
```

**Secrets Management:**
```bash
npx wrangler secret list            # View what secrets are set
npx wrangler secret put SECRET_NAME # Add/update a secret
npx wrangler secret delete SECRET_NAME
```

## Critical Rules

1. **Git First, Deploy Second**: ALWAYS push to GitHub before deploying. This ensures the repo stays in sync with production.

2. **Migrations Before Deploy**: If you created a new migration file in `/migrations`, apply it with the D1 command BEFORE deploying the Worker.

3. **Never Commit Secrets**: Secrets like API keys go in `.dev.vars` (local) or via `wrangler secret put` (production). Never in git.

4. **Database Name is `rally-database`**: Always use this exact name in wrangler commands (with hyphen, not underscore).

5. **Remote Flag for Production**: Use `--remote` flag when working with production database. Without it, commands run against local dev database.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Running `npx wrangler deploy` without pushing to git first
- ❌ Forgetting to apply migrations before deploying code changes
- ❌ Using `--local` flag when intending to modify production database
- ❌ Deploying without testing locally first with `npx wrangler dev`

## Deployment Checklist

Before running `npx wrangler deploy`:
- [ ] All code changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Database migrations applied (if any)
- [ ] Tested locally with `npx wrangler dev`
- [ ] Secrets are configured: `npx wrangler secret list`
- [ ] Wrangler.toml has correct `database_id`

After deploying:
- [ ] Test by sending email to Rally address
- [ ] Check logs: `npx wrangler tail`
- [ ] Verify admin dashboard works

## Configuration Files

- `wrangler.toml` - Worker configuration, database bindings
- `.dev.vars` - Local secrets (gitignored, never commit)
- `migrations/*.sql` - Database schema changes

## When Things Break

```bash
# View deployment logs
npx wrangler tail

# Check database is accessible
npx wrangler d1 execute rally-database --remote --command "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM messages"

# Verify secrets are set
npx wrangler secret list

# Test locally before deploying
npx wrangler dev
```

**Remember**: Git → Migrations → Deploy. Every time.
